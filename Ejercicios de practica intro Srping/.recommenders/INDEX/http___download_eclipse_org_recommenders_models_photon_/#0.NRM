EclipseLink 2.6
Eclipse Kepler simultaneous release
Target Date - June 2013
About
The 
EclipseLink
 project's goal is to provide a complete persistence framework that is both comprehensive and universal. It will run in any Java environment and read and write objects to virtually any type of data source, including relational databases, and XML. EclipseLink will focus on providing leading edge support, including advanced feature extensions, for the dominant persistence standards for each target data source; Java Persistence API (JPA) for relational databases, Java API for XML Binding (JAXB) for XML, Service Data Objects (SDO), and Database Web services (DBWS).

About EclipseLink 2.6
EclipseLink 2.6
Eclipse Kepler simultaneous release
Target Date - June 2013
About
The 
EclipseLink
 project's goal is to provide a complete persistence framework that is both comprehensive and universal. It will run in any Java environment and read and write objects to virtually any type of data source, including relational databases, and XML. EclipseLink will focus on providing leading edge support, including advanced feature extensions, for the dominant persistence standards for each target data source; Java Persistence API (JPA) for relational databases, Java API for XML Binding (JAXB) for XML, Service Data Objects (SDO), and Database Web services (DBWS).
